# The following chunk is code. Basically, we have a student object that has his/her score and experience attributes and probability calculation methods. Note that:
# 1. NRMP data is included in the object, so **please change the file directory accordingly to load the data**. 
# 2. For NRMP data, whenever there are not enough data for a certain specialty, i.e. less than 4 records in the matched and unmatched for the given specialty, status and step 1 score/ step 2CK score/research/publications, we leave out the specialty and find the probability based on the status and step 1 score/ step 2CK score/research/publications. The same applies when a certain specialty can not be found with the given status. In the above two cases, a warning message will be displayed.
# 3. RM data is not included in the object. The probabiliy level is directly encoded for number of attempts and YOG based on RM data. To be more specific, for number of attempts:
#     * USIMG students
#         * attempts <= 2: high
#         * attempts = 3: average
#         * otherwise: low
#     * NONUSIMG students
#         * attempts = 0, high
#         * attempts = 3 or 4: average
#         * otherwise: low
#         
#     for YOGï¼š
#     * USIMG students
#         * YOG <= 2005: low
#         * YOG (2010, 2015]: average
#         * otherwise: high
#     * NONUSIMG students
#         * YOG (2015,2020]: low
#         * YOG (2005, 2010]: high
#         * otherwise: average
#      
#
